QIAseq miRNA Data Analysis: How to analyze

1. Go to qiagen.com/geneglobe
2. Click on “Data Analysis Center”
3. In the Data Analysis Center:
     -Under “Choose Format”: Select “NGS” and then select “Primary QIAseq miRNA Quantification”
     -Choose “Pack Size” and “Instrument”
     -You will now be routed to the primary analysis portal
4. In the primary analysis portal:
     -Under “File Upload”, upload the FastQ files
     -Under “File Management”, select the FastQ files you would like to map and click “Preselect”
     -Under “miRNA Quantification Jobs”:
         a)Select “Species” from the dropdown menu
         b)Select “Files Lanes” from the dropdown menu
         c)Click “Create Jobs”
         d)Periodically refresh the page by clicking “miRNA Quantification Jobs” tab. Job status will change from “queued” to
          “in progress” to ultimately “done successfully”.
     -When the job has finished, you can either click “Download Report” to receive the primary analysis output or click
      “Secondary Analysis” to immediately proceed to Secondary Analysis.
5. In the secondary analysis portal:
     -Under “Analysis setup”, go to “Sample Manager” to define sample group
     -Under “Analysis setup”, go to “Select Normalization Method” to choose the normalization option for the data
     -Under “Analysis”, observe the Fold-Regulation and Fold-Change results
     -Under “Plots & charts”, observe visual representations of the data
     -Under “Export data”, choose what data you want to export, and then click “Export”
